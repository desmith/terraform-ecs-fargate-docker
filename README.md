# Sample Terraform project to build (not sure when the build happens actually) and deploy an ecs Fargate application.

TODO:
1. Create a local variable which contains the namespace of the application.
   - Name of cluster/app
   - S3 prefix for Terraform.tfstate file
   - cloudwatch log groups
   - VPC
   - tags
   - ??? (wherever else it makes sense...)
